# Image Recognition App

Image Recognition App is an Android application built using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin. It utilizes a TensorFlow model to recognize monuments in real-time using the device's camera.

## Features

- Open the camera and detect monuments in real-time.
- Display the name of the detected monument.
- Easy to use and lightweight.
